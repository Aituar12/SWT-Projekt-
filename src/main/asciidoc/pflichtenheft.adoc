== Summary
This chapter outlines our project, which involves creating a website for a hotel. The hotel's website will serve three distinct user groups: the manager, the staff, and the customers. Each group will have specific permissions and access levels, as elaborated in subsequent sections.

The primary function of the website is to facilitate room and suite bookings, with various inventory options and features designed to cater to any number of guests. Furthermore, the website will enable staff members to make reservations on behalf of customers who contact the hotel, as well as manage bookings, including cancellations.

In addition, the manager will have a suite of tools at their disposal. They can oversee the hotel's cleaning staff through a cleaning planner and manage employee vacation schedules. Moreover, they will be able to track the hotel's revenue on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, and adjust room furniture and inventory accordingly. This feature allows the manager to optimize the hotel's offerings in response to demand fluctuations.

== Task

For a hotel, which is about to be completed, software is to be developed to support the staff in their daily work. The main focus is on room management and reservation.

In addition, other areas of responsibility have to be covered. The hotel has many single and double rooms. These differ in size, equipment and last but not least in price. Furthermore, the house offers its guests different suites with a different number of rooms. As with the single and double rooms, there are also suites with different sizes and equipment. It should also be noted that both the price and the equipment of the rooms and suites are subject to change at any time. The programm should be flexible enough to allow it to be adapted as easily as possible to new circumstances. 

The room reservation can be made either by telephone or via the internet. The principle of the order process is the same in both cases. After the guest has expressed their wishes (number of rooms, number of beds, equipment, period, etc. ), the program should list all available rooms corresponding to the mentioned criteria. In the event that the desired combination is not available within the specified period, the system should suggest possible alternatives. Several rooms/suites can also be booked in a single order. The price per night depends on the size and equipment of the rooms as well as on the desired food (breakfast, half board or full board). In addition, a surcharge is charged depending on the season.

Reservations can be cancelled at any time, however a fee will be charged. For this purpose, some data of the guests, such as name and Credit card data must be stored. The occupancy or reservation of the individual rooms should be available to the staff at any time. When guests arrive, their personal  data is completed. Guests who do not check-in will be charged the full amount. Upon departure, each guest receives a detailed invoice for the cost of accommodation, meals, consumption of the mini-bar, room service, etc.

The occupied rooms are cleaned daily. At the same time, the consumption of the mini-bar is recorded. Both are the responsibility of the cleaning staff, who have to be reassigned to the corresponding rooms every day. This task is not always trivial, since cleaning depends on
size of the rooms different time-consuming. In addition, a final cleaning of the rooms is necessary on the day of departure, for which additional time has to be scheduled.

Finally, some administrative tasks should be mentioned. For example, every day a list of the income and expenses of the previous day should be available. It should also be possible to look at statistics covering a longer period of time. Furthermore, the manager also needs various statistical evaluations, such as the average occupancy of the rooms. Staff should also be able to use the system to: submit holiday requests, which in turn can be processed by the hotel manager.

In the end, with the software, the users should be able to:

* Login and Logout
* search for rooms in the catalogue
* make a reservation
* cancel a reservation

Additionally the staff and the managers should be able to:

* assign cleaning staff
* put in vacation requests
* look at statistics for the hotel

== Productusage

The system is going to be used as a Hotel Website by the company {company_name} to allow the customers to view rooms of the hotel and make bookings.
The software is supposed to run on a server and be available through the internet (via a browser) to interested customers, staff and hotel managers 24/7.

The system shall be accessible and visually optimized for the following browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox, version 92.0.1+
- Google Chrome, version 94.0.4606+
- Safari, version 14.0+


The primary users of the software are adult people (customers, staff and hotel manager), who supposedly know typical website navigation schemas,
who all do not necessarily have a technical background.

The system shall not need technical maintenance. The software should be expandable and dynamic in order to support the employees in the best possible way.
Any data shall be stored persistently in a database and be accessible through the application (e.g. no SQL knowledge should be required for the staff and hotel manager).

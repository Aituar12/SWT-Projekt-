== Notes

* we implemented the filtering to the catalog
* all issues from the sonarqube have been resolved
* test coverage is at 56%

== Current

* Questions:
** How do we deal with Money amounts?
*** take as string from html, put string in database, convert string to numeric value
** Integration Tests?
*** We can start them to make sonarqube coverage higher by already starting with integration tests
** Code coverage?
*** overall coverage counts for the quality gate, not the line coverage if we are dealing with them in the backend
** What can be understood by expenses:
*** salaries, electricity (can be static, does not have to be dynamic), food expenses (this should be dynamic)
*** salaries on fixed date: e.g: manger clicks refresh button : new expenses are added based on the current date
** credit card:
*** sales-point wants "real" sales-point credit card -> idea: when paying order customer credit info (currently as string) is transformed to sales-point credit card, just for the ordering process
*** oli will update the credit card to have more attributes than currently (add expiration date etc.)

* Task distribution is done via Trello:

== Planning of the next Sprints

* more unittests so that test coverage is at 60%
* make catalog site pretty
* add more rooms with differences to better test the filtering logic
* add small description to transaction entries
* add "profit" text under Transactions
* add overall amount on money the manager has at available, which is updated dynamically based on revenues and expenses that are made in the hotel (CAN-CRITERIA, not mandatory)
